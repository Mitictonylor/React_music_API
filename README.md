# Homework
Learning objectives
- Practise making a request in a React app and passing the data from that request down the chain of components
- Practise using stateless components

**Task**
Make a simple React app that displays the current UK top 20 songs. You can get the data for this here:

https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/topsongs/limit=20/json

You are required to use a stateless component as part of your app.

The MVP is to request the data, then display the list of songs with each song showing its chart position, title and artist. If you donâ€™t like music (why?!) you can go to the link below and choose a different iTunes chart for books/movies etc.

**Extensions**
Add more information - you could include images or the preview song audio clips. Style this nicely with CSS.

## To Run

After downloaded, in the Terminal at project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

and after

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
